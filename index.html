    <h1>Anxiety</h1>


<div>
    <p>Anxiety is the feeling we get when we are worried, tense or afraid. It can be a normal response to situations where we may feel threatened or under pressure (e.g. an exam).</p>
    <p>Sometimes anxiety can impact your ability to live life how you want to, according to <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/anxiety-and-panic-attacks/about-anxiety/">Mind</a> it can become a problem if: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your feelings of anxiety are very strong and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Your fears and worries are out of proportion to the situation.</li>
            <li>You avoid situations that might cause you to be anxious.</li>
            <li>Your worries feel very distressing and hard to control.</li>
            <li>You regularly experience symptoms of anxiety.</li>
            <li>You find it hard to go about your everyday life or do things you enjoy.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>My Experience:</h2>   
<p> My anxiety first started in primary school when we used to play tennis in year 6. On the days we left school to play tennis I could feel my heart pounding, I would then start to feel queasy, sweat and throw up before each game. It was weird because once I was there, I was completely fine! It seemed that the thought and perception I had of playing tennis was worse than actually playing tennis. </p>
<p> The feelings of anxiety continued into secondary school where I used to throw up most days before school in year 7. Luckily, as the years progressed, I felt more comfortable at school so the anxiety eased but it was still always there in the back of my mind. </p>
<p> It was not until my twenties when my anxiety returned at full force. I got into an unhealthy relationship and my way of thinking completely changed. Negative thoughts plagued my mindset and I would always jump to the worst case scenario resulting in feelings of deep insecurity. I felt like a nightmare to my friends and I would constantly speak to them about my worries like a broken record.</p>
<p> The relationship ended but feelings of insecurity and anxiety continued. It was not until summer 2020 during the pandemic where I had time to reflect. I realised I needed to seek help and started Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. I also worked on developing healthier habits and positive lifestyle choices. </p>
<p> At present, I still struggle with anxiety but not to the same extent as before.</p>
