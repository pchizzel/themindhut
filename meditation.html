        <p>Meditation and breathing excercises can help alleviate symptoms of anxiety by slowing down your thoughts and the feeling of panic. Meditation is considered a type of mind-body complementary medicine. Meditation can produce a deep state of relaxation and a tranquil mind. During meditation, you focus your attention and eliminate the stream of jumbled thoughts that may be crowding your mind and causing stress. This process may result in enhanced physical and emotional well-being. Meditation can give you a sense of calm, peace and balance that can benefit both your emotional well-being and your overall health.</p>

        <p>Meditation helped me put things into perspective and focus on things to be grateful for through positive affirmations.</p>
        <p>Positive affirmations are essentially positive thoughts that you repeat to yourself. I found it helpful to repeat these statements either first thing in the morning or last thing before bed.</p>
        <p>Here are my top 5 positive affirmations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I am grateful to be alive.</li>
            <li>I am grateful for all my friends and family.</li>
            <li>All I can do is be the best I can be.</li>
            <li>I am proud of myself.</li>
            <li>I will be okay.</li>
        </ul>
