    <h1>Challenge Your Thoughts</h1>
    <div>
    <p>Anxiety can be caused by intrusive negative thoughts that are often uncontrollable. These thoughts are not necessarily true but due to our perception we view them as true and even factual. These thoughts are often a manifestation unhelpful thinking styles.</p>

    <h3>Steps to challenging your thoughts:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Identify the situation that is making you feel anxious - e.g. going to a party with people you don't know.</li>
        <li>Identify your feelings surrounding the situation - e.g. nervous, worried, stressed.</li>
        <li>Identify the unhelpful thoughts - e.g. "what if people don't like me?" "what if I say something stupid?".</li>
        <li>Facts that support the unhelpful thought - e.g. "I said something dumb last time to a stranger I just met".</li>
        <li>Facts that provide evidence against the unhelpful thought - e.g. "I have friends so clearly people do like me" "I am predicting by thinking I won't enjoy the party".</li>
        <li>Generate a balanced and more realistic perspective - e.g. "I will have fun at this party!"</li>
    </ol>
